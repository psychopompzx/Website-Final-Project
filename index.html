          The Deathblade in Lost Ark is an Assassin type class that wields 3 Swords; two Daggers and one Longsword.
          The Deathblade is a Melee DPS, primarily attacking in close rage distance.
          They fight with the flurry of a thousand cuts with a chaotic fast-paced slashing style.
          Their musical instrument is a Flute.
          The Identity Gauge of the Deathblade is the Art Meter.
          The Art Meter fills upon successful hits with attacks filling up 3 Death Orbs.
          Death Orbs can be activated with z and the Deathblade will enter into an enhanced state known as Art.
          Art gives the player a number of beneficial improvements: granting immunity to crowd control effects,
          restoring Mana to full, and lastly, depending on how many orbs were activated will provide greater benefits.
          The scaling benefit is as follows:
          <ul>
            <li> Pick an Image (careful of the file extension in the URL)
            <li> Record URL, cite it, comment for date accessm and record original dimensions
            <li> Use blockquote and comment as appropiate
            <li> Use img-tag with atributes src, alt, title, and style with width-height
          </ul>
